# Laboratoare-.NET-24

This repository contains the first laboratories for the **Introduction to .NET** course conducted during the 1st semester of the 3rd year of the Bachelor's Degree at the Faculty of Computer Science.

## Project Repository

The project for this course can be found [here](https://github.com/Mareantz/Proiect-.NET-2024).

## Overview

These laboratories served as an introduction to the **Clean Architecture** design pattern. I developed a small **Book Management Application** that includes API endpoints for managing books, supporting all CRUD operations:
- **Get by ID:** Retrieve a specific book using its unique identifier.
- **Get All:** Retrieve a list of all books.
- **Create:** Add a new book to the collection.
- **Update:** Modify the details of an existing book.
- **Delete:** Remove a book from the collection.

The application demonstrates how to structure a .NET project following Clean Architecture principles, ensuring separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability.
